## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Ruby 2.3
- Rails 5.1
- Postgres
- An RSA key pair (pub key generated by external auth service in production)
- Gmail account
- Auth service set up on your computer (follow: https://github.com/raen79/authentication)
### Installation
#### Environment Variables
`dot-env` gem is installed and so you can set up all your environment variables in a .env file at the root of the project. The following environment variables need to be set:
```
DB_USER = username for you DB
DB_PWD = password for your DB user
GM_USER = Gmail email address
GM_PWD = Gmail password
RSA_PUBLIC_KEY = Your public RSA key (don't worry about \n they are handled)
RSA_PRIVATE_KEY Your RSA private key (only used in testing, so only necessary in test/dev env, in production an external auth service which has not yet been set up will take care of the jwt token gen)
AUTH_URL = url string of your authentication service (https://subdomain.domain.com or localhost:port)
```
The production environment only needs `GM_USER`, `GM_PWD`, and `RSA_PUBLIC_KEY` set up.
#### Database
```
$ bundle exec rails db:setup
```
